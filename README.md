# Human Endogenous Retrovirus Project

Interrogation of unannotated HERVs in colorectal transcriptomes.

## Synopsis

Human endogenous retroviruses are poorly annotated genomic elements that are often selectively transcribed in cancers. Here, we examine whether unannotated retroviral elements are selectively transcribed in colorectal cancer and identify seven with potential as biomarkers or immunotargets.
