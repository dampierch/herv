The number of significant latent factors was estimated with the \verb|num.sv| function with the the Buja Eyuboglu method using a full model with terms for an intercept and tissue phenotype.
The latent factors themselves were estimated with the \verb|svaseq| function using the same full model and a null model with an intercept term alone.
